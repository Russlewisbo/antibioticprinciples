## What will we discuss

<br>

-   Key pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of antibiotics and *practical considerations*
-   Pharmacodynamics (PD)
    -   How is it determined pre-clinically, clinically
    -   How can knowledge of PD be used to maximize antibiotic activity
-   How should PK/PD information be used to predict/individualize patient therapy?
-   Combination therapy

## Definitions: Absorption-Bioavailibility {.smaller}

<br>

-   **Bioavailability = AUCoral / AUCiv**
    -   The relative amount of drug that reaches the greater systemic circulation (i.e. following absorption & first-pass metabolism)
    -   It is the proportion of drug that gets into the plasma compared to if you injected the same amount IV
-   **In order to get to the plasma the drug goes through:**
    -   Ingestion
    -   Transit to GI tract
    -   Absorption in small intestinal mucosa
    -   First pass metabolism in small intestinal mucosa and liver
-   **Bioavailability is used to determine:**
    -   The optimal route to achieve the therapeutic concentration
    -   The amount of drug that needs to be given orally

-   Stomach: Little absorption takes place for most drugs here (thick gastric mucous layer prevents significant drug absorption).
-   Small intestine: Transit time 4-6h; 6-7 m long x 2.5cm internal diameter.
-   It has a larger surface area (30-35m^2^) than the stomach (\~1m^2^), due to:
    -   Jejunal plicae circulare (circular infoldings) - increases surface area 1.6x
    -   Epithelial villi + microvilli: increases surface area 80-100x.
-   Additional factors aiding absorption:
    -   Peristalsis churns the intestinal contents, ensuring regular contact between drugs & epithelium.
    -   pH is 6-7 (weakly acidic) —\> determines the ratio of drug molecules that exist in the ionized and unionized state.

## Transiting the GI epithelium into the bloodstream
<br>
<br>

| **Method of transit**     | **Substrate**                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Passive diffusion**     | \<500Da, lipophilic, not ionic   |
| **Facilitated diffusion** | \<500Da, Lipophobic, ionic drugs |
| **Active transport**      | Ionised drugs                    |
| **Pinocytosis**           | Large molecules                  |

-   The commonest way for many drugs to cross lipid membranes (Esp. if small \[\<500 Da\] & not strongly ionic)

-   Lipophilic drugs (e.g. steroids) easily pass through lipid bilayers

    -   The pKa/b of the weak acid/base determines their rate of uptake:

        -   pKa = pH at which the acid is 50% ionised (A-) & 50% in the unionised form (AH)

        -   pKb is the same for bases

    -   Ionised drug can’t diffuse through a lipid bilayer

    -   Unionised drug moves out of the gut lumen, (e.g., as an AH form). Afterwards, ionic (A-) drug molecules combine with free H+ to become AH, which can then move across by passive diffusion

    -   This re-equilibration between ionised & unionised forms continues along the entire length of the gut, with increasing amounts of the drug being gradually absorbed.

## A note about absorption and pH {.smaller}

<br>

-   Drugs are often ‘weak acids’ or ‘weak bases’, and so their rate of passive uptake is determined by the ratio of ionised:unionised drug in the gut lumen:

    -   Acidic drug (A): Can release a H+ ion, going from HA —\> A- and H+

    -   Basic drug (B): Can accept a H+ ion going from B —\> BH+ (protonated base)

-   The pKa/b of the weak acid/base determines their rate of uptake:

    -   pKa = pH at which the acid is 50% ionised (A-) & 50% in the unionised form (AH)

    -   pKb is the same for bases

-   Ionised drug can’t diffuse through a lipid bilayer

-   Unionised drug moves out of the gut lumen, (e.g. as an AH form). Afterwards, ionic (A-) drug molecules combine with free H+ to become AH, which can then move across by passive diffusion

-   This re-equilibration between ionised & unionised forms continues along the entire length of the gut, with increasing amounts of the drug being gradually absorbed
