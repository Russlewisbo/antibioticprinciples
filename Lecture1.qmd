## Definitions: Absorption-Bioavailibility {.smaller}

<br>

-   **Bioavailability = AUCoral / AUCiv**
    -   The relative amount of drug that reaches the greater systemic circulation (i.e. following absorption & first-pass metabolism)
    -   It is the proportion of drug that gets into the plasma vs. the same amount injected IV
-   **In order to get to the plasma the drug goes through:**
    -   Ingestion
    -   Transit through the GI tract
    -   Absorption in small intestinal mucosa
    -   First pass metabolism in small intestinal mucosa and liver
-   **Bioavailability is used to determine:**
    -   The optimal route to achieve the therapeutic concentration
    -   The amount of drug that needs to be given orally

## Oral absorption in the GI tract {.smaller}

<br>

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/GI-Tract.png){width="500"}
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
-   **Stomach:** Little absorption takes place for most drugs here (thick gastric mucous layer prevents significant drug absorption)
-   **Small intestine:** Transit time 4-6h; 6-7 m long x 2.5cm internal diameter
    -   It has a larger surface area (30-35m^2^) than the stomach (\~1m^2^), due to:
        -   Jejunal plicae circulare (circular infoldings) - increases surface area 1.6x
        -   Epithelial villi + microvilli: increases surface area 80-100x
-   **Additional factors aiding absorption:**
    -   Peristalsis churns the intestinal contents, ensuring regular contact between drugs & epithelium
    -   pH is 6-7 (weakly acidic) —\> determines the ratio of drug molecules that exist in the ionized and unionized state

## Transiting the GI epithelium into the bloodstream

<br> <br>

| **Method of transit**     | **Substrate**                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Passive diffusion**     | \<500Da, lipophilic, not ionic   |
| **Facilitated diffusion** | \<500Da, Lipophobic, ionic drugs |
| **Active transport**      | Ionised drugs                    |
| **Pinocytosis**           | Large molecules                  |

## Passive diffusion: <br>How most antibiotics are absorbed {.smaller}

<br>

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![](images/diffusion.png)
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
-   The commonest way for many drugs to cross lipid membranes (Esp. if small \[\<500 Da\] & not strongly ionic)

-   Lipophilic drugs (e.g. steroids) easily pass through lipid bilayers

    -   The pKa/b of the weak acid/base determines their rate of uptake:

        -   pKa = pH at which the acid is 50% ionised (A-) & 50% in the unionised form (AH)

        -   pKb is the same for bases

    -   Ionised drug can’t diffuse through a lipid bilayer

    -   Unionised drug moves out of the gut lumen, (e.g., as an AH form)

        -   Afterwards, ionic (A-) drug molecules combine with free H+ to become AH, which can then move across by passive diffusion

    -   This re-equilibration between ionised & unionised forms continues along the entire length of the gut, with increasing amounts of the drug being gradually absorbed
:::
:::

## A note about absorption and pH {.smaller}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="20%"}
![](images/stickynote.jpeg.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="80%"}
-   **Drugs are often ‘weak acids’ or ‘weak bases’, and so their rate of passive uptake is determined by the ratio of ionised:unionised drug in the gut lumen:**

    -   Acidic drug (A): Can release a H+ ion, going from HA —\> A- and H+

    -   Basic drug (B): Can accept a H+ ion going from B —\> BH+ (protonated base)

-   **The pKa/b of the weak acid/base determines their rate of uptake:**

    -   pKa = pH at which the acid is 50% ionised (A-) & 50% in the unionised form (AH)

    -   pKb is the same for bases

-   **Ionised drug can’t diffuse through a lipid bilayer**

-   Unionised drug moves out of the gut lumen, (e.g., as an AH form). Afterwards, ionic (A-) drug molecules combine with free H+ to become AH, which can then move across by passive diffusion

-   This re-equilibration between ionised & unionised forms continues along the entire length of the gut, with increasing amounts of the drug being gradually absorbed

## Facilitated diffusion {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<br> <br> ![](images/diffusion.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
<br> <br>

-   This is how lipophobic drugs cross cell membranes

-   This passively happens across an electrochemical concentration gradient.

-   Facilitated by solute carrier transporters (SLCs), which are present in the GIT, liver & kidney.

-   A note on SLCs:

    -   SLCs are a group (\>350 types) of transmembrane proteins that facilitate absorption of organic charged molecules up to 500 Daltons.
    -   2 types: <br>

|                                |                             |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| AT Organic Anion Transporter   | Carry deprotonated acids A- |
| OCT Organic Cation Transporter | Carry protonated bases BH+  |
:::
:::

## Active transport {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
<br> <br> ![](images/diffusion.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
<br> <br> - **Primary AT**:

-   **Primary AT:** Mostly efflux of drugs from cells/specific body compartments

    -   More important in limiting drug uptake

-   **Secondary AT**: This is how ionised drugs are absorbed

    -   Carried out by SLCs (both OATs & OCTs) across pre-existing electrochemical gradients.
    -   Drugs are co-transported e.g. with Na if moving into the intracellular space, or K if moving into the extracellular space
    -   e.g. H+ and beta-lactam antibiotics

-   **Pinocytosis:** This is used to deliver large molecules across tissue barriers (e.g. blood-brain barrier)

    -   Endocytosis: the cell membrane invaginates to non-specifically capture molecules present at the cell surface, pinching them off into a vesicle
    -   Exocytosis is the opposite; vesicles are ejected from the cell
:::
:::

## First pass metabolism {.smaller}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
![](images/Pharmacokinetics%20Principles.png)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
<br> <br>

-   A small amount occurs in the gut epithelia before entering the portal vein. Most occurs in the liver.

-   As the drug passes through the liver some enters the hepatocytes and is metabolised by the CYP450 enzymes.

| Acid-stable   | Acid-labile              |
| Soluble       | Low solubility           |

## Caveats to bioavailibility

<br>

-   Amoxicillin: Absorption is saturable, and after 750mg no more is likely to be absorbed.

-   Cefalexin: Maximum amount absorbed is \~4g/d

-   Macrolides: Not well-absorbed, but concentrate intracellularly

-   ‘UTI drugs’: Fosfomycin, Trimethoprim, Nitrofurantoin, Pivmecillinam: Don’t get great plasma levels, but concentrate in urine preferentially —\> still useful for UTI

## Factors affecting Vd: Drug characteristics

![](images/hydrophilic.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Volume of distribution is affected by the physicochemical properties of the drug

-   Factors that favor low Vd: high water solubility, high protein binding, decreased tissue binding → converse is also true

## Clinical utility of Vd

::: aside
Provides information on how much antibiotic is distributed in tissues vs. plasma → some clinical relevance

e.g., doxycycline, tigecycline do not achieve peak concentrations in bloodstream that surpass the MIC of many pathogens
:::

## Factors affecting Vd: Vascular {background-image="images/capillary.png" background-opacity="0.2"}

<br> <br>

-   **Drugs diffuse from capillary beds—\> interstitial —\> intracellular space**

-   **More vascular (e.g. heart, lung, kidney) = more drug delivered to them than others (e.g. skin, bone, fat)**

-   **Capillary leakiness:**

    -   Some capillary bed epithelial cells are fenestrated by 60-80nm diameter pores (e.g. intestinal, endocrine, pancreatic and kidney).

    -   In others endothelial cells are separated by slit junctions or large intercellular gaps to allow large movements of molecular material (Liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen).

    -   These ‘leak’ points facilitate access to the interstitial fluid.

## Sepsis alters the Vd of antibiotics {.smaller}

![](images/vd3.png){width="800"}

Release of inflammatory mediators causes damage to the vascular endothelium, resulting in expansion of extravascular space (increased volume of distribution)

## Factors affecting Vd: Body size and chronic diseases

![](images/vd2.png)

## How is the drug metabolised, concentrated or excreted?
